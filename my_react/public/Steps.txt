What steps I've taken in this project

1. npx create-react-app my_firstapp

2. Intsalled react-router-dom for Routing

3. After configuring Route in Routes we linked Home Component

4. Home component is the Home page and the first sub component of Home page is navigationbar

5. We imported Css file within the same directory to add styles to the componenets

6. Navigationbar component consits icons which we used it from https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/ installing package 

npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react

7. Added assets folder that contains images for the project 

8. Next to the Main section we added a sidebar consists of 2 section one showing details and other showing list of close friends

9. Close friends are being rendered from a dummy database created under Src folder

10. Using mapping function for each item in user database we created a component with name and picture
